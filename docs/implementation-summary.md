# Velocity.js Chevrotain Parser Implementation Summary

## Implementation Summary

This document provides an overview of the current status of the Chevrotain-based Velocity parser implementation.

### Accomplishments

- Lexer can tokenize all Velocity syntax elements, including:

  - Variable references with property access
  - Directives (#set, #if, #foreach)
  - All comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
  - All logical operators: &&, ||
  - All arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, /, %
  - String literals and comments
  - Number literals

- Parser successfully implements grammar rules for:
  - Basic content parsing
  - Variable references with property access
  - Directive structure (#set, #if, #foreach)
  - Expressions in directives
  - Equality comparison (==) and not-equality (!=) in if conditions

### Current Limitations

- Number literal handling is being improved to ensure correct parsing in comparison operations
- While NotEqual (!=) and Equal (==) comparison operators are fully implemented, other comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=) are tokenized but not fully parsed
- Logical operators (&&, ||) are tokenized but not fully parsed
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, %) are tokenized but not fully parsed
- String literal handling differs slightly between Jison and Chevrotain - Chevrotain includes quotes in the token image, which requires additional handling

### Next Steps

1. Complete support for all comparison operators in if directives

   - Improve number literal handling in comparison operations
   - Fix CST to AST conversion for comparison operations

2. Implement support for logical operators in if directives

   - Add proper visitor methods for logical operation nodes
   - Ensure logical operator precedence matches the Jison implementation

3. Implement arithmetic operators in expressions

   - Add proper rules for arithmetic operator precedence
   - Ensure correct AST structure for arithmetic operations

4. Enhance directive implementation

   - Add support for directives with more complex expressions
   - Implement nested directive handling

5. Standardize string literal handling
   - Ensure consistent string handling between parsers
   - Add proper escaping support in string literals

### Development Methodology

We're following a methodical, incremental implementation approach:

1. Implement and test each feature independently
2. Verify each implementation against the original Jison parser
3. Document progress and limitations
4. Identify and prioritize next steps based on test coverage

### Test Framework

The implementation is validated using a comprehensive test suite that:

1. Tests token generation with specified inputs
2. Compares AST output with the original Jison parser
3. Verifies semantic equivalence of the generated ASTs

This approach ensures compatibility with the existing Velocity.js implementation while providing a more maintainable and extensible parser architecture.

## Conclusion

The foundation for a modern, maintainable Chevrotain-based parser for Velocity templates has been established. The current implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach and provides a clear path forward for completing the implementation.

With continued development following the outlined plans, the Chevrotain parser will eventually replace the Jison parser, providing a more maintainable and extensible solution for parsing Velocity templates.
