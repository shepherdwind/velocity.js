# Velocity.js Chevrotain Parser Implementation Summary

## Accomplishments

We have successfully implemented a basic Chevrotain-based parser for Velocity templates with the following capabilities:

1. **Lexical Analysis**

   - A robust lexer that can tokenize all Velocity syntax elements
   - Support for basic tokens (variable references, directives, content)
   - Support for all comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
   - Support for logical operators (&&, ||, !)
   - Support for arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, %)
   - Implemented token filtering to handle overlapping tokens (like NotEqual and Equal)

2. **Parsing Rules**

   - Grammar rules for basic Velocity template language constructs
   - Support for variable references (simple and formal)
   - Support for property access
   - Basic directive parsing (set, if, foreach)
   - Implemented equality (==) and inequality (!=) comparisons in if conditions

3. **CST to AST Conversion**

   - Visitor pattern implementation to convert CST to AST
   - AST structure compatible with the existing Jison parser
   - Position tracking for error reporting
   - Support for equality (==) and inequality (!=) comparisons in expressions

4. **Testing**

   - Comprehensive test cases for basic parsing functionality
   - Tokenization tests for all operators
   - Validation against Jison parser output
   - Framework for comparing AST outputs between parsers (ignoring position info)

5. **Documentation**
   - Detailed implementation plan for remaining tasks
   - Documentation of current capabilities and limitations
   - Test-driven development approach with verification against Jison

## Current Limitations

The current implementation has the following limitations that need to be addressed in future work:

1. **Partial Expression Support**

   - Only equality (==) and inequality (!=) comparisons are fully implemented in the parser and visitor
   - Other comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=) are tokenized but not parsed
   - Logical and arithmetic operators are recognized by the lexer but not handled by the parser

2. **String Literal Handling**

   - Chevrotain AST preserves quotes in string literals ("test")
   - Jison AST removes quotes (test)
   - This difference is handled in tests but needs a consistent approach

3. **Limited Directive Support**

   - Only basic structure for directives, without full semantic handling
   - No support for nested directives
   - No support for complex constructs like macros

4. **Method and Function Calls**

   - No support for method calls with arguments
   - No support for chained method calls

## Next Steps

Based on the implementation plan documents, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Complete Comparison Operator Support**

   - Implement parser rules for remaining comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=)
   - Update the visitor to handle these operators
   - Add tests with Jison comparison for each operator

2. **Implement Logical Operator Support**

   - Add parser rules for logical operations (!, &&, ||)
   - Implement visitor methods for logical expressions
   - Ensure proper operator precedence

3. **Implement Arithmetic Expression Support**

   - Add parser rules for arithmetic operations (\*, /, %, +, -)
   - Create visitor methods for arithmetic expressions
   - Test with various numeric expressions

4. **Enhance Directive Implementation**

   - Complete set directive with support for complex expressions
   - Implement conditional directives with proper nesting
   - Add foreach directive with iteration context
   - Implement macro directives

5. **String Literal Handling**
   - Standardize string literal format to match Jison output
   - Either strip quotes in visitor or update runtime code

## Development Methodology

The development follows a structured approach:

1. **Incremental Implementation**

   - Add support for one feature at a time
   - Start with tokenization, then parser rules, then visitor methods
   - Test each component thoroughly before moving on

2. **Test-Driven Verification**

   - Create test cases that compare with Jison parser output
   - Verify AST structure compatibility
   - Document discrepancies that need to be addressed

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Keep documentation in sync with implementation
   - Maintain clear records of current capabilities and limitations
   - Provide detailed plans for next steps

## Conclusion

The foundation for a modern, maintainable Chevrotain-based parser for Velocity templates has been established. The current implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach and provides a clear path forward for completing the implementation.

With continued development following the outlined plans, the Chevrotain parser will eventually replace the Jison parser, providing a more maintainable and extensible solution for parsing Velocity templates.
